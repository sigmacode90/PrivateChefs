        <h1>About Our Founder</h1>
        <p>
          My name is <strong>Avanganino Parmagino</strong>, and I lead a team of the world’s
          most talented private chefs. Originally from Italy, I brought my
          passion for authentic cuisine to the United States to start <strong>Il cibo è cattivo</strong>, blending
          traditional European artistry with modern culinary innovation.
        </p>

        <p>
          What began as a small private dining service for close friends and
          families in Milan has evolved into a global network of highly trained
          chefs serving clients across the world. Each of our chefs is carefully
          selected for their creativity, discipline, and deep understanding of
          international cuisines.

        retreats, our mission is to craft personalized, unforgettable culinary
         moments that linger long after the last bite.
