These Terms constitute a binding legal agreement between you and Private Chefs by Avangani Parmagino, located in the State of Florida, United States.

Payment for services may be made by cash or credit card in person at the time of service or completion, unless otherwise agreed in writing.

All prices are quoted in U.S. dollars (USD).

Deposits: Some services may require a deposit or retainer to confirm booking. Deposits are non-refundable unless otherwise stated.

Cancellations: Cancellations made within 48 hours of the scheduled service may incur a cancellation fee.

We reserve the right to modify our pricing or payment terms at any time, with notice provided before new rates take effect.
